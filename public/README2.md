PROJECT NOTES 

For this Project I decided to stay strictly with the assignment and try to copy the exact Netflix layout (unlike  my calculator project where I got tied up in the creative side and lost a lot of valuable time in those details.)

I had to request a unique API Key to access the data from TMBD which is hidden in my env folder and the first lines in my app.js folder so when I post to github the code isn't out there for anyone to grab 

I learned how import it is to always make sure you're only running one terminal and how to check this, and how to properly close and restart your terminal (ctrl c)

Then I created my Favicon logo and my 'not netflix' logo next so I would have that out of the way and not spend a ton of time on those details.
